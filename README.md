# KYC-verfication-using-blockchain
KYC is a process to verify identity and related details of an institution’s customers.KYC(Know your customer)processes are used by most financial companies and banks to help in their anti-money laundering efforts. One of the major problems right now is that different institutions are using their own methods and ways, leading to the lack of standardization in the processes,along with each customer finding it extremely annoying to go through this procedure with he and every bank he/she wishes to open an account in. This also means that companies cannot track the transactions done on other platforms which makes each institution have their own set of incomplete data.There is considerable wastage of costs in the form of opportunity cost, maintenance cost, customer verification cost and many more . Digitisation of KYC processes has to some extent reduced the time and effort for both the customers and the service-providers, but even this system comes with its own flaws.The processes currently in use have a high risk of error, are tiresome,long and repetitive creating a bothersome experience for customers. Despite all their efforts, the data is still susceptible to being stolen and misused .According to appentive.com estimates, the amount of KYC spending rose to up to $1.2 Billion in 2020 on a global level.With such huge amounts like mentioned above being spent on KYC processes one would expect them to be unhackable and issues-free. But in spite of this KYC processes tend to be inefficient, time consuming and labour intensive till date .We have proposed an enhanced KYC system using blockchain technology to improve the existing KYC system. An inherent feature of the DLT is used to remove the third-party involvement, and smart contracts are used to build our logic in the mobility of the data. Blockchain technology has various types of cryptographic security which provide a safer medium of transaction over an unsecured channel. We’ve used Solidity programming language that provides tools to develop smart contracts, run on Ethereum.We have deployed our smart contracts using remix
